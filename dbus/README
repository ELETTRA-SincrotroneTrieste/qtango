These classes have been introduced with QTango version 4.2.0
They provide adaptors and interfaces to the DBus session bus,
to allow QTango applications to interact with each other.

TApplicationAdaptor.xml provides the interface to TApplication.

From TApplicationAdaptor.xml it is possible to generate TApplicationAdaptor.h,
TApplicationInterface.h and TApplicationInterface.cpp, by means 
of the qdbusxml2cpp utility.

Since the arguments involved in many methods of the interface are
of QDBusVariant type, it is not possible to correctly and straightforward
generate the cpp implementation for TApplicationAdaptor.

So the command line used to generate the interface is 

qdbusxml2cpp TApplicationAdaptor.xml -c TApplicationInterface -p TApplicationInterface

while to generate the adaptor, use 

qdbusxml2cpp  TApplicationAdaptor.xml -a TApplicationAdaptor.h -c TApplicationAdaptor

Using "-a TApplicationAdaptor.h" makes qdbusxml2cpp generate the class declaration AND
implementation inside the TApplicationAdaptor.h generated file.
You must then manually remove the implementation from the .h file, and add it to the
.cpp when the interface is updted adding or removing methods.

NOTE:

qdbusxml2cpp  TApplicationAdaptor.xml -a TApplicationAdaptor -c TApplicationAdaptor

would generate .h and .cpp separate files, but the .cpp file would overwrite the 
current implementation thus preventing things from working because of QDBusVariant
arguments, as hinted above.

NOTE (II):
Interface generation changes from Qt 4.3 to later releases. On Qt 4.6 qdbusxml2cpp 
generates QDBusPendingReply instead of QDBusReply, and this is not backward compatible.

NOTE (III): when generating interface, note that QDBusReply<> is not accepted.
You must reply <> with <void>
