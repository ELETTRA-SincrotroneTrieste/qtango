A simple qtangocore reader that demostrates how to use qtango core in your QApplication.

Some notes:

- the event loop is needed to deliver signals to slots. This means: if you run a while(1) infinite cycle,
  for instance, this won't work.

- Inside widget context, the code is sipler than this!

Usage: specify a command line argument that provides a device and an attribute:

./bin/simplereader test/device/2/double_scalar
