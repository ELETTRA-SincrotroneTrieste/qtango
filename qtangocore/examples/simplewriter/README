A simple qtangocore writer that demostrates how to use qtango core in your QApplication.

Some notes:

- the event loop is needed to deliver signals to slots. This means: if you run a while(1) infinite cycle,
  for instance, this won't work.

- Inside widget context, the code is sipler than this!

- Read carefully all comments

Usage: specify a command line argument that provides a device and an attribute or a device and a command:

./bin/simplewriter test/device/2/double_scalar 
./bin/simplewriter "test/device/2->DevDouble"  (remember the "" around the argument if this represents a command)
