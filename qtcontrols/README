Author: Giacomo Strangolino/V. Forchi`
Release: 3.1

A set of Qt4 widgets ready to be used with the qtangocore framework.


REQUIREMENTS:
you need at least Tango 6.1.1.
you will also need qmake to generate Makefile.

CONFIGURATION:
to adapt the distribution to your environment modify paths and other
things in the .pro file pointed by qmake.custom.3 and install.


INSTALL:
Use qmake, then make and finally execute the install script:
1) with qmake: run qmake after you built all the targets and then install
        # qmake && make
2) with install script
        # ./install

Note: make install does not behave as expected. Please use ./install instead.


PYTHON NOTE:
notice that pyuic4 includes the widgets in this way:
from ELed import ELed
because it takes this information from the designer plugin. since there is only
one python module for all widgets you should replace those lines with
from PyQtControls import *
you can easily solve this problem running pyuic4 this way:

pyuic4 -x myform.ui | perl -p -e 's/from E[A-Za-z]+ import E[A-Za-z]+\n/ABCDE/g' | perl -p -e 's/^(ABCDE)+/from PyQtControls import *\n/g' > mycode.py

I'm not a reg-exp expert so I wasn't able to find a way to replace all 
the lines at once, so I had to use a temporary string (ABCDE) that you can't
use in your code (this is definitely a dirty solution). If you know a way 
feel free to contact me.
