Since version release_5_4_0: 
support for Qt5. If qt5 qmake is used, all the libraries will end with the "-qt5" suffix, for example
libQTango6-qt5.so, libqtcontrols6-qt5.so, libqtango6-qt5plugin.so and so on.

All libraries that depend from qtango must behave consequently, linking with the "-qt5" version of the QTango library.
The file to include is always {INCLUDE_PATH}/qtango5/qtango.pri
qtango.pri detects the qmake version and appends the "-qt5" library suffix when needed.

Since QTango version 6.0, tango 9 and omniorb 4.2.0 are used. 
{INCLUDE_PATH}/qtango6/qtango.pri must be included.


/usr/local/tango-9.1.0/include/tango.

Dependencies:
qt libraries (qtsvg, qtopengl, qtcore, qtgui, qtxml)
libxmu
libqwt6
zmq
tango
omniorb


This change is taken into account in the qtango.pri project configuration 
file of the QTango distribution since version 4.2.1 (see unix:INCLUDEPATH
directive in qtango.pri).

If you are going to build QTango with a previous version of tango, then 
modify the unix:INCLUDEPATH directive in qtango.pri according to the 
tango include installation path.

Compilation

qmake
make [-jN ]
make install
