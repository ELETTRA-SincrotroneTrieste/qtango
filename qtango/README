Author: Giacomo Strangolino/V. Forchi`
Release: 3.1

mailto: giacomo.strangolino@elettra.trieste.it

a framework to simply interact with Tango device servers,
see documentation for more infos.
QTango combines qtcontrol widgets and qtangocore to provide a high level set of widgets
ready to read and write Tango quantities.

REQUIREMENTS:
you need at least Tango 6.1.1.
you will also need qmake to generate Makefile.

CONFIGURATION:
to adapt the distribution to your environment modify paths and other
things in the .pro file pointed by qmake.custom.3 and install.


INSTALL:
Use qmake, then make and finally execute the install script:
1) with qmake: run qmake after you built all the targets and then install
        # qmake && make
2) with install script
        # ./install

Note: make install does not behave as expected. Please use ./install instead.



PYTHON NOTE:
notice that pyuic4 includes the widgets in this way:
from TLabel import TLabel
because it takes this information from the designer plugin. since there is only
one python module for all widgets you should replace those lines with
from PyQTango import *
you can easily solve this problem running pyuic4 this way:

pyuic4 -x myform.ui | perl -p -e 's/from T[A-Za-z]+ import T[A-Za-z]+\n/ABCDE/g' | perl -p -e 's/^(ABCDE)+/from PyQTango import *\n/g' > mycode.py

I'm not a reg-exp expert so I wasn't able to find a way to replace all
the lines at once, so I had to use a temporary string (ABCDE) that you can't
use in your code (this is definitely a dirty solution). If you know a way
feel free to contact me.
