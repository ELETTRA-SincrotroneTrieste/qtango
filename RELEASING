QTango X.Y.Z

Changes in Z represent bugfix releases over the X.Y release. Binary and source compatible.

Changes in Y represent minor features introduced since previous X.Y release. Binary and source
compatible.

Changes in X represent major release and may require full rebuild of the applications linked to 
the library. Changes in X number mean that the package is not source nor binary compatible with
previous releases. Since X >= 5, the releases are expected to stay source and binary compatible.
Actually, the release of QTango 5 is planned to be structured with design patterns that will ensure
binary compatibility with future versions.
