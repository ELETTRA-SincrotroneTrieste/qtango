Modify exercise 2 so that the attribute is written not on slider move but
after pressing a TPushButton that is connected to the target and passes the
value read from the slider.
	Design is simpler: slider is still connected to the spin box but does not
execute the writing.
Slider must subclass SimpleDataProxy and implement the getData() method
(slot), where the position of the slider (as integer) must be converted to
the correct value to write to the attribute, according to the minimum and
maximum values recorded into the Tango database.
TPushButton will be linked to the Slider object name to read the input
value.
The slider will still be a QTangoComProxyWriter in order to know the
minimum and maximum values of the attribute.
